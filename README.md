This file numerically solves the 2D wave equation, a classical partial differential equation (PDE),
where U represents the signal, x represents position, t represents time, and c represents the wave velocity (dependent on spatial parameters). 
The numerical scheme employs the finite difference method. The program implements various boundary conditions, including Neumann, Dirichlet, and Mur boundary conditions. 
Originally developed by SACHA BINDER (Copyright 2021), the code has been modified to simulate pulses within a cavity.
