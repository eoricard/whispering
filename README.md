This file numerically solves the 2D wave equation, a classical partial differential equation (PDE), where U represents the signal, x is the position, t is the time, and c is the wave velocity (dependent on spatial parameters). The numerical method used is the finite difference method. The program supports various boundary conditions, including Neumann, Dirichlet, and Mur. 

Originally developed by Sacha Binder (Copyright 2021), the code has been modified to simulate pulses within a cavity.
