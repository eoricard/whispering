This file was built to solve numerically a classical PDE, 2D wave equation. 

where
 - U represents the signal
 - x represents the position
 - t represents the time
 - c represents the velocity of the wave (depends on space parameters)

The numerical scheme is based on finite difference method. This program is also providing several boundary conditions.
More particularly the Neumann, Dirichlet and Mur boundary conditions.
